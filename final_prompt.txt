User: # Agent Tool Hook Enhancement Task

## Context and Baseline

This repository contains a tiny, repetitive implementation of an
"agent tool hook" layer. The baseline is functionally correct but awkward and
hard to extend. Your goal is to enhance the design without changing
externally observable behavior.

The baseline implementation lives in a single read‑only file:

- `agent_tools_hook_origin.py`

You must not edit, rename, move, or delete this file. All enhancements must be
implemented in **new files** that build on top of the existing functions.

The baseline defines three functions:

- `call_tool_a(tool, name, args) -> dict`
- `call_tool_b(tool, name, args) -> dict`
- `run_all(tools, names, payloads) -> list[dict]`

Each `call_tool_*` function takes a callable tool plus some metadata and
returns a plain dictionary with `tool_name`, `status`, `error`, `args`,
`output`, and a list of log strings. The two functions only differ in log
messages. `run_all` alternates between them.

The baseline is **correct but crude**: it returns loosely structured
dictionaries that are hard to rely on and extend.

## Pain Points and Motivation

This hook layer is a typical "Enhancement" target:

- Heavy copy‑paste between `call_tool_a` and `call_tool_b`.
- Result shape is only informally described.
- Logging is an unstructured list of strings.
- Orchestration and low‑level call details are mixed.

You must introduce a clearer, more modular design that keeps observable
behavior compatible while making the code easier to reason about, extend, and
test.

## Non‑Negotiable Constraints

You must respect the following constraints:

1. **Baseline file is read‑only.** `agent_tools_hook_origin.py` must not be
  modified. New behavior must live in new modules or packages (for example,
  `agent_tools_hook.py`, `agent_hooks/runner.py`, etc.).
2. **Observable behavior must stay compatible.** For the same input tools,
   names, and payloads, your enhanced orchestration should:
   - Call the underlying tools the same number of times and in the same
     order.
   - Produce results whose core fields (`tool_name`, `status`, `error`,
     `args`, `output`, `logs`) are semantically equivalent to the baseline,
     including the sequence of log messages.
   - Preserve success vs error classification and error messages.
3. **You may add structure but not remove meaning.** You may wrap the
  dictionaries in dataclasses or other types, or enrich logs (for example
  with timestamps), as long as the original dictionary plus log strings can
  still be recovered exactly.
4. **Only add files.** Do not change or delete the baseline file. New
  abstractions and public APIs must live in new modules.
5. **No hard‑coded shortcuts.** Do not special‑case individual tools or names
  in ways that break generality; the framework should work for any callable
  that matches the expected interface.
6. **Windows and standard library only.** All code must run on Windows 10+
  with Python 3.8+ and may only use the standard library (plus optional
  `pytest`).
7. **Unified test entry.** The root of this case contains `run_tests.py`. It
  is the **only** supported way to run automated tests and is read‑only.
8. **Automatic test discovery.** All tests must live under a `tests/`
  directory and be discoverable automatically by `run_tests.py`.
9. **pytest preferred, unittest fallback.** `run_tests.py` first tries to use
  `pytest` and falls back to `unittest` discovery if `pytest` is not
  available. Your tests must pass in both modes.
10. **Exit codes reflect test results.** When all tests pass, `run_tests.py`
  must exit with code 0. Any failure or error must produce a non‑zero
  exit code.
11. **No custom PASS banners.** Do not add custom "PASS" / "All tests passed"
    style success messages in the test entry or helpers. Rely on the default
    reporting of the test framework.

## High‑Level Tasks

Focus on high‑level design instead of a step‑by‑step checklist. In particular,
you should:

- Introduce clear types or structures to represent tool invocations, results
  and logs.
- Centralize the common logic for calling tools, handling exceptions and
  collecting logs into a reusable component.
- Expose a small, well‑defined orchestration API that tests and other modules
  can call, without changing baseline semantics.

## Deliverables

By the end of this task, the repository should contain at least:

- An enhanced hook implementation (for example, `agent_tools_hook.py` or a
  small `agent_hooks/` package) that exposes a clear public API for invoking
  tools.
- Automated tests under `tests/` that compare baseline functions in
  `agent_tools_hook_origin.py` with your enhanced API, check that core fields
  stay equivalent, and verify that structured representations can be converted
  back into the baseline dictionary format.
- A short `README` that describes the baseline pain points, your enhanced
  architecture, and how to run all tests on Windows using `python run_tests.py`.

## Output Requirements

In your final answer for this task, you should:

- Summarize the main new modules, packages and types you introduced, with a
  short description for each.
- Describe the primary public API of your enhanced hook layer, with a brief
  example of how to call it.
- Explain how to run the tests from the repository root (for example,
  `python run_tests.py`) and how the exit code indicates success or failure.

You do **not** need to print special success labels such as
"Tests passed: X/Y". The primary indicator of success is that `run_tests.py`
finishes with exit code 0 and the test framework reports no failures.
