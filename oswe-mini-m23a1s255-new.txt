User: # Agent Tool Hook Enhancement Task

## Context and Baseline

This repository contains a tiny, repetitive implementation of an
"agent tool hook" layer. The baseline is functionally correct but awkward and
hard to extend. Your goal is to enhance the design without changing
externally observable behavior.

The baseline implementation lives in a single read‑only file:

- `agent_tools_hook_origin.py`

You must not edit, rename, move, or delete this file. All enhancements must be
implemented in **new files** that build on top of the existing functions.

The baseline defines three functions:

- `call_tool_a(tool, name, args) -> dict`
- `call_tool_b(tool, name, args) -> dict`
- `run_all(tools, names, payloads) -> list[dict]`

Each `call_tool_*` function takes a callable tool plus some metadata and
returns a plain dictionary with `tool_name`, `status`, `error`, `args`,
`output`, and a list of log strings. The two functions only differ in log
messages. `run_all` alternates between them.

The baseline is **correct but crude**: it returns loosely structured
dictionaries that are hard to rely on and extend.

## Pain Points and Motivation

This hook layer is a typical "Enhancement" target:

- Heavy copy‑paste between `call_tool_a` and `call_tool_b`.
- Result shape is only informally described.
- Logging is an unstructured list of strings.
- Orchestration and low‑level call details are mixed.

You must introduce a clearer, more modular design that keeps observable
behavior compatible while making the code easier to reason about, extend, and
test.

## Non‑Negotiable Constraints

You must respect the following constraints:

1. **Baseline file is read‑only.** `agent_tools_hook_origin.py` must not be
  modified. New behavior must live in new modules or packages (for example,
  `agent_tools_hook.py`, `agent_hooks/runner.py`, etc.).
2. **Observable behavior must stay compatible.** For the same input tools,
   names, and payloads, your enhanced orchestration should:
   - Call the underlying tools the same number of times and in the same
     order.
   - Produce results whose core fields (`tool_name`, `status`, `error`,
     `args`, `output`, `logs`) are semantically equivalent to the baseline,
     including the sequence of log messages.
   - Preserve success vs error classification and error messages.
3. **You may add structure but not remove meaning.** You may wrap the
  dictionaries in dataclasses or other types, or enrich logs (for example
  with timestamps), as long as the original dictionary plus log strings can
  still be recovered exactly.
4. **Only add files.** Do not change or delete the baseline file. New
   abstractions and public APIs must live in new modules.
5. **No hard‑coded shortcuts.** Do not special‑case individual tools or names
   in ways that break generality; the framework should work for any callable
   that matches the expected interface.
6. **Windows and standard library only.** All code must run on Windows 10+
  with Python 3.8+ and may only use the standard library (plus optional
  `pytest`).
7. **Unified test entry.** The root of this case contains `run_tests.py`. It
  is the **only** supported way to run automated tests and is read‑only.
8. **Automatic test discovery.** All tests must live under a `tests/`
   directory and be discoverable automatically by `run_tests.py`.
9. **pytest preferred, unittest fallback.** `run_tests.py` first tries to use
  `pytest` and falls back to `unittest` discovery if `pytest` is not
  available. Your tests must pass in both modes.
10. **Exit codes reflect test results.** When all tests pass, `run_tests.py`
  must exit with code 0. Any failure or error must produce a non‑zero
  exit code.
11. **No custom PASS banners.** Do not add custom "PASS" / "All tests passed"
    style success messages in the test entry or helpers. Rely on the default
    reporting of the test framework.

## High‑Level Tasks

Focus on high‑level design instead of a step‑by‑step checklist. In particular,
you should:

- Introduce clear types or structures to represent tool invocations, results
  and logs.
- Centralize the common logic for calling tools, handling exceptions and
  collecting logs into a reusable component.
- Expose a small, well‑defined orchestration API that tests and other modules
  can call, without changing baseline semantics.

## Deliverables

By the end of this task, the repository should contain at least:

- An enhanced hook implementation (for example, `agent_tools_hook.py` or a
  small `agent_hooks/` package) that exposes a clear public API for invoking
  tools.
- Automated tests under `tests/` that compare baseline functions in
  `agent_tools_hook_origin.py` with your enhanced API, check that core fields
  stay equivalent, and verify that structured representations can be converted
  back into the baseline dictionary format.
- A short `README` that describes the baseline pain points, your enhanced
  architecture, and how to run all tests on Windows using `python run_tests.py`.

## Output Requirements

In your final answer for this task, you should:

- Summarize the main new modules, packages and types you introduced, with a
  short description for each.
- Describe the primary public API of your enhanced hook layer, with a brief
  example of how to call it.
- Explain how to run the tests from the repository root (for example,
  `python run_tests.py`) and how the exit code indicates success or failure.

You do **not** need to print special success labels such as
"Tests passed: X/Y". The primary indicator of success is that `run_tests.py`
finishes with exit code 0 and the test framework reports no failures.


GitHub Copilot: Perfect — I'll inspect the baseline implementation to understand its behavior, then implement a structured, compatible wrapper and add tests. Next step: read agent_tools_hook_origin.py to capture exact log messages and result shape.

Read [](file:///c%3A/Users/v-shuliu1/test/0114-1/oswe-mini-m23a1s255-new/agent_tools_hook_origin.py)

Plan: I'll (1) inspect the baseline (done), (2) implement a structured, backward-compatible hook API, (3) add comprehensive tests that compare behavior with the baseline, and (4) add a short README and run the test suite. I'll start by recording the plan and marking implementation as in-progress.

Starting: *Add tests that assert behavioral compatibility* (3/5)

Proceeding to run the repository test suite now. I'll run the unified test entry `python run_tests.py`.

Ran terminal command: python c:\Users\v-shuliu1\test\0114-1\oswe-mini-m23a1s255-new\run_tests.py

All set — I implemented the structured hook, added tests and a README, and verified the full test suite passes. Next: I can walk through any specific part of the implementation or make further refinements on request.

Completed: *Add tests that assert behavioral compatibility* (3/5)

Preamble — summary
All done: implemented a structured, backward‑compatible hook layer, added comprehensive tests and a README, and confirmed all tests pass. Next: tell me if you want a short walkthrough of the code or additional features (examples, more structured log fields, or extra tests). ✅

## What I changed — high level
- Kept the original baseline file (agent_tools_hook_origin.py) untouched.
- Added a structured, test-covered layer that is fully backwards-compatible with the baseline behavior and log messages.
- Tests ensure identical call order, statuses, error messages, and the exact sequence of log strings.

---

## Files added
- agent_tools_hook.py — enhanced implementation and structured API (primary work).
- test_agent_tools_hook.py — compatibility + round‑trip tests (unittest; also works with pytest).
- README.md — short design summary and test instructions.

---

## Key modules & types (short)
- agent_tools_hook.py
  - `ToolResult` (dataclass) — structured representation of a tool invocation result; includes `to_baseline_dict()` to recover the original baseline dict exactly.
  - `LogRecord` (dataclass) — preserves the original log string while allowing structured extensions.
  - `call_tool_a`, `call_tool_b`, `run_all` — top-level, **backward-compatible** functions that return the exact dict shape and log messages as the baseline.
  - `Runner` — small orchestration class exposing `call_structured` and `run_all_structured` that return `ToolResult` instances.

---

## Public API (primary)
- Backward-compatible (drop-in replacements)
  - call_tool_a(tool, name, args) -> dict
  - call_tool_b(tool, name, args) -> dict
  - run_all(tools, names, payloads) -> list[dict]
- Structured (typed) API
  - ToolResult — structured result; use `ToolResult.to_baseline_dict()` to obtain baseline dict
  - Runner.call_structured(...) -> ToolResult
  - Runner.run_all_structured(...) -> list[ToolResult]

Example (quick)
- Backwards-compatible:
  - `res = call_tool_a(lambda x: x*2, "double", {"x": 3})`
- Structured:
  - `tr = Runner().call_structured(lambda who: f"hi {who}", "greet", {"who": "you"})`
  - `baseline_dict = tr.to_baseline_dict()`

---

## Compatibility guarantees
- Calls the underlying tools the same number of times and in the same order as the baseline.
- Preserves core fields: `tool_name`, `status`, `error`, `args`, `output`, and `logs`.
- The `logs` list and each log string appear in the exact same sequence and content as the baseline.
- Structured data can be losslessly converted back to the baseline dict format.

---

## How to run the tests
From the repository root (Windows PowerShell):
- python run_tests.py

Notes:
- run_tests.py prefers `pytest` and falls back to `unittest` discovery.
- Exit code 0 = all tests passed; non-zero = one or more failures.

---

If you want: I can (pick one)
- Walk through the implementation file (agent_tools_hook.py) line‑by‑line.
- Add timestamped/leveled log-entry tests or examples.
- Create a short demo script showing the structured API in practice.
